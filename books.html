                        one about an ominous white rat called the Bane. The Underlanders know there is only one way to
                        lure Gregor back to their world: by kidnapping his little sister, Boots.

                        agrees to let them go--on the condition that she travels with them.When they arrive in the
                        subterranean city, the plague is spreading--and one of Gregor's family is stricken.
